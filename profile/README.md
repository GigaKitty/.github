🐾 GigaKitty

Open-source tools for automated finance, built by humans for humans.

At GigaKitty, we create open-source solutions that make automated trading accessible, transparent, and easy to self-host. Whether you're an individual trader, a fintech startup, or a curious tinkerer, our tools are designed to help you automate your financial strategies with confidence and control.

We believe financial automation should be:

    🧩 Modular – Easily composable tools that adapt to your needs
    ⚙️ Deployable – Simple to run locally or in the cloud
    🧠 Understandable – Code you can read, learn from, and trust
    🐱 Self-managed – You own it. We just make it easier

You’re welcome to use, fork, or extend any of our projects. Want a custom solution? Need help setting up a secure deployment? Just reach out—we’re friendly humans, not bots.
